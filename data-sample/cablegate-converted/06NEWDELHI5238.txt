SUBJECT: GOI BOLSTERING SECURITY FOR AFGHANISTAN ROAD 
PROJECT 
 
Classified By: A/PolCouns Jon P. Dorschner for reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
 ¶1.  (C) On July 25, Poloff met with MEA Undersecretary 
Aquino Vimal (Afghanistan) to discuss current Indian aid 
programs in Afghanistan.  Vimal confirmed that the GOI has 
sent additional federal police forces (Indo-Tibetan Border 
Patrol) in batches of 20-30 troops per month, to bolster 
security for the Indian-funded Zaranj-Delaram road-building 
project in the southwestern Nimruz province.  This has 
increased the number of Indian paramilitary troops in 
Afghanistan from 40 at the beginning of the year to nearly 
300 now.  Vimal added that these troops do not have a mandate 
for aggressive action, and are limited strictly to defense of 
the construction compound. 
 
¶2.  (C) Vimal had little substantive to say about current 
progress of GOI aid projects in Afghanistan, (including 
promised GOI military aid to the ANA,) stating "our embassy 
in Kabul actually handles all the logistics, and then sends 
us the bill."  He urged us to inquire with the Indian embassy 
in Kabul. 
 
¶3.  (C) Vimal confirmed that the Afghan and Indian Foreign 
Ministers will attend the July 29 - August 3 SAARC (South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) conclave in 
Dhaka.  He also noted that Foreign Secretary Saran will 
likely go to Kabul next month but provided no further 
details.  Vimal also mentioned that the Afghan and Indian 
Commerce Ministers plan to meet in Kabul, but a date has not 
yet been set.
