SUBJECT: INDIA'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORY BOARD: ADVISING 
THE ADVISORS 
 
Classified By: A/PolCouns Jon Dorschner for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: The National Security Advisory Board -- 
populated by civilians, but supported by the GOI National 
Security Council Secretariat -- is a little-discussed 
institution designed to provide creative long-term 
assessments to the National Security Advisor, and through him 
to the Cabinet and PM.  Indian analysts have been quick to 
note structural issues which they say impede the strategic 
thinking process among the NSAB membership, and have lamented 
that much of India's internal strategic thinking occurs not 
within the walls of government, but on the pages of the daily 
newspaper's editorial section.  This report includes 
biographic notes of the current NSAB members.  End Summary. 
 
A "Who's Who" Eminent Persons 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The NSAB is a civilian body that provides inputs into 
national security decision-making.  Its membership is a 
"Who's Who" of retired bureaucrats, diplomats, senior 
military officers and security officials, as well as 
journalists, scientists, economists, and other eminent 
persons.  The NSAB lacks its own offices, staff, etc., and 
relies on the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS, 
see Septel) for logistical support. 
 
¶3.  (C) Current NSAB member Narendra Singh Sisodia -- who was 
also the NSCS's first Additional Secretary -- told PolOff the 
NSAB meets as often as 4-6 times per month for 1-2 days,at 
the direction of the Convenor.  Most meetings are open to the 
full membership, but attendance is not required; some members 
reside outside Delhi, which makes full meetings a rarity. The agenda is typically devoted to a single topic.  The 
Convenor may arrange 
briefings by government officials or outside experts if he so 
desires; these are usually unclassified, but NSAB members do 
receive security clearances and are cautioned not to discuss 
Board proceedings, which probably contributes to the dearth 
of NSAB media coverage (beyond publication of a lightly 
annotated roster when a new Board 
 
Designed for "Out-of-the-Tiffin" Thinking 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Some NSAB meetings are specifically designated for 
only a subset of the full membership, and the NSAB Convenor 
sometimes creates sub-groups to consider and critique 
specific topics.  For example, Joshi told us the current NSAB 
has made recommendations on New Delhi's policies on Kashmir, 
Bangladesh, and hostage situations, among others.  According 
to Sisodia, although the NSA can task the NSAB to produce 
papers on specific topics, most of its production is 
self-initiated. 
 
¶5.  (C) The typical NSAB product is a paper outlining policy 
options and likely consequences that is forwarded to the NSA, 
which can then choose to send it up to the Cabinet-level NSC 
or the Cabinet Committee on Security (the top decision-making 
body on national security issues).  The NSAB's mandate is to 
be holistic, forward-leaning, strategic vice tactical -- to 
provide (as Joshi once quipped) "out-of-the-tiffin" thinking. 
 As such, Sisodia said it is discouraged from responding to 
the "news of the day."

Nuclear, Indo-Pak Origins 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The first NSAB was formed in December 1998 to 
consider a nuclear doctrine for India, including command and 
control.  The first two NSABs included several members of the 
Kargil Core Group, which was tasked to correct perceived 
errors in Indian strategic thinking that eventually led to 
the 1999 Kargil War, the first war between a nuclear-armed 
India and Pakistan. 
 
Structure Impedes Developing Strategic Vision 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Hardline nationalist commentator Bharat Karnad, a 
member of the first NSAB, criticized the GOI's 
decision-making institutions for preventing the government 
from developing a "true" strategic vision.  Karnad reflected 
that many commentators in India provide what he dismissed as 
"casual strategic analysis" -- spot commentary on strategic 
topics -- but few provide "real analysis" on critical issues 
or "develop bodies of consistent work."  He lamented that 
much of India's national security debate unfolds not within 
the environment of the NSC, NSCS, and NSAB, but through 
newspaper editorials.  Karnad lambasted the way Indian 
bureaucrats are hired, trained, and promoted; the preference 
for generalists over specialists and shifting bureaucrats 
sufficiently often to prevent them from accumulating depth of 
experience "stunted India's strategic thinking." 
 
¶8.  (C) Not surprisingly, Karnad applauded the first NSAB (of 
which he was a member), describing it as "stocked with 
strategic thinkers."  He also called the first NSAB 
"aggressive" and said it refused to back down to politicians 
or bureaucrats, which he added caused some discomfort in 
government circles.  To avoid such discomfort in subsequent 
NSABs, Karnad continued, they were filled with former 
bureaucrats "who are safer for the government."  However, he 
concluded, safe bureaucrats do not help develop India's 
strategic vision. 
 
¶9.  (C) Prominent security commentator Rear Admiral (ret.) 
Raja Menon said that one impediment to making the NSAB 
operate smoothly is the absence of a dedicated staff.  He 
contended that few Indian civilian officials appreciate the 
importance of a professional staff, and that initiatives to 
create them are often killed by turf-conscious bureaucrats. 
(NOTE: This emphasis on possessing a qualified staff is an 
attitude common to senior Indian military officers.  End 
Note.)
