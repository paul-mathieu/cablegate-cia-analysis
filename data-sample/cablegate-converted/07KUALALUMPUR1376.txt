SUBJECT: MALAYSIA: NO RESPONSE YET ON INVITATION TO 
LUNCHEON HOSTED BY MRS. BUSH, SEPT. 24 
 
REF: STATE 126167 
 
Embassy conveyed Mrs. Laura Bush's invitation to Prime 
Minister Abdullah Badawi's wife, Datin Seri Jeanne Abdullah, 
via diplomatic note on August 28, and we have followed up 
since then with Malaysian officials.  On September 10, the 
Foreign Ministry's Americas Division informed us that the 
Prime Minister and his wife do not yet have a firm travel 
itinerary for attending UNGA.  According to the MFA, the 
Prime Minister and Mrs. Abdullah will most likely arrive in 
New York on the evening of September 24 or on September 25. 
In addition, the Foreign Ministry did not know if the Muslim 
fasting month would preclude Mrs. Abdullah's participation in 
the lunch.  We will continue to request a formal response to 
this invitation.
