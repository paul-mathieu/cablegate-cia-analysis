(B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:   Mubarak and Sarkozy reportedly are in 
agreement on the need to move quickly on the 
Israel-Palestinian front, following their meeting in Paris 
July 21.  According to one of Sarkozy,s key advisors, 
Mubarak shares Sarkozy,s interest in convening an 
international conference as a means of jump-starting the 
issue.  The advisor previewed that Mubarak and Sarkozy may 
soon approach President Obama directly about their ideas. 
Israeli Pol Chief in Paris separately indicated they too have 
heard of a possible Franco-Egyptian initiative.   End Summary. 
 
GROWING CONCERN 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  According to Elysee Americas advisor (and acting 
Middle East advisor) Damien Loras, Egyptian President Mubarak 
expressed impatience with the pace of the U.S. efforts in the 
Middle East when meeting July 21 with President Sarkozy. 
Mubarak, like the Saudis and other Arab leaders, deeply 
appreciates the close cooperation with the U.S. and U.S. 
attention to the issue, but after six months, there is 
growing concern over the pace and ability of the U.S. to be 
strong enough to convince Israel to yield on settlements. 
They are well aware of the possible constraints on the 
President, including key domestic issues on the President,s 
agenda that will demand his attention and the support of 
Congress. 
¶3.  (C) Sarkozy, according to Loras, shared Mubarak,s 
analysis and his impatience. Sarkozy is also concerned that a 
compromise with Israel over settlements policy is inevitable; 
therefore it would be best to move to that stage quickly. 
Progressing deliberately and still arriving at a compromise 
may make it more difficult to bring the Arabs fully on board. 
 At the same time, Sarkozy emphasized to Mubarak, as he will 
with other Arab leaders, that it is past time for the Arabs 
to take some positive steps. 
 
PUTTING SARKOZY,S CONFERENCE IDEA TO GOOD USE? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Mubarak and Sarkozy reportedly agreed on the need to 
bring the parties together in the not-too-distant future; to 
outline their responsibilities and the parameters of a 
settlement; and to set a relatively short timeline for them 
to engage seriously on the issues.  Loras stressed that 
Sarkozy,s recurring proposal for a conference is ¬ a 
gadget,8 but rather it is a tool that could be used to help 
bring about progress.  As Sarkozy and his advisors see it, 
the U.S. is working first to seek an Israeli agreement on a 
settlement freeze, to be followed by steps taken by the Arabs 
and subsequently by additional steps by all parties.  They 
are concerned that Israel would be satisfied with greater 
Arab recognition and not be inclined to do more.   The French 
believe that putting the idea of a conference into the mix 
soon would put pressure on both the Israelis and 
Palestinians, particularly if it is true that Netanyahu wants 
to avoid such a conference at all costs.  If the 
prospect/threat of a conference produces voluntary results, 
fine; if it doesn,t, then in the French view, a conference 
would be among the paths open to the international community 
in any case. 
¶5.  (C)  Loras previewed that Presidents Mubarak and Sarkozy 
will likely put a joint initiative or request before 
President Obama in the near future.  Israeli Political 
Counselor separately hinted to us that they had heard about a 
possible Franco-Egyptian initiative.  In a separate meeting, 
Acting MFA Middle East Director Paucelle was more cautious, 
indicating that while Sarkozy and Mubarak share a sense of 
urgency, Mubarak may choose not to join with Sarkozy in 
approaching President Obama or even in promoting Sarkozy,s 
conference initiative.
