Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  President Uribe authorized representatives of families of 
FARC hostages to seek direct meetings with the terrorist 
group and work towards an exchange of FARC hostages for 
imprisoned terrorists.  Representatives of the families, 
including the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, blamed the FARC 
for their loved ones' captivity but said Uribe should do more 
to free them.  In an interview with a French newspaper, Uribe 
outlined why the FARC's professed interest in an humanitarian 
accord was not sincere and reiterated his commitment to 
fighting them.  End summary.

Uribe Authorizes Families to Seek FARC Contact 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  On February 24, the presidency issued a statement 
authorizing families of FARC hostages to seek direct meetings 
with the terrorist group to facilitate an "humanitarian 
accord."  The statement said the GOC was amenable to contact 
with the FARC and authorized hostage family spokesperson Lucy 
de Gechen, wife of FARC hostage and Senator Jorge Eduardo 
Gechen, to contact the group.  The statement followed Uribe's 
February 22 declaration that the GOC would intensify the 
fight against the FARC because it had rejected Uribe's most 
recent outreach effort, threatening rather than cooperating 
with Uribe's (unnamed) emissary.

Families Worry About Rhetoric

¶3.  Yolando Pulecio, mother of FARC hostage and former 
presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, criticized the FARC 
and Uribe on February 23, the occasion of Betancourt's 5th 
anniversary of captivity.  She recognized the FARC's 
responsibility for taking her daughter hostage, but said 
Uribe had not done enough to free her, points echoed by 
Betancourt's two children, who now live in France.  Claudia 
Rujeles, wife of FARC hostage and former Meta governor Alan 
Jara, said the FARC was intransigent, but urged Uribe to 
overcome obstacles to an exchange of hostages for imprisoned 
FARC terrorists.  A number of hostage family representatives 
criticized the rhetoric used by all sides, calling for 
concrete steps to free their loved ones.

Uribe Outlines Obstacles to Accord 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, 
published on the presidency website on February 21, Uribe 
said he was ready to meet with the FARC anywhere to discuss 
an humanitarian accord, but saw three obstacles.  First, the 
FARC was not serious about the accord.  It had continually 
mislead interlocutors and had demonstrated no interest in 
serious talks.  Second, Uribe said the terrorist group had 
refused to accept a December 2005 European proposal for a 
200km security zone to discuss an exchange, free of all armed 
actors, including GOC and FARC forces.  Uribe repeated the 
GOC would not accept a "demilitarized zone" that allowed FARC 
terrorists to operate freely, a concession the FARC had 
seriously abused during the presidency of Andres Pastrana. 
Third, Uribe pointed out the FARC had refused to agree that 
FARC terrorists released from jail enter GOC reintegration 
programs or go into exile rather than return to FARC ranks. 
 
¶5.  Uribe insisted the GOC would continue to make every 
effort to secure the hostages' release, either through an 
humanitarian accord or through rescue efforts, if warranted.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  The current flurry of comments surrounding an 
humanitarian accord stems from the fifth anniversary of 
Betancourt's seizure by the FARC, and does not represent any 
real movement by the GOC or the FARC on the issue.
