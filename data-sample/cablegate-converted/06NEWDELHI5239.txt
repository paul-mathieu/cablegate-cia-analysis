¶1.  (SBU) Summary: During the Indo-Pak Composite Dialogue 
talks on Terrorism and Narcotics Trafficking on May 30 in 
Islamabad, Home Secretary VK Duggal and his Pakistani 
counterpart Interior Secretary Syed Kamal Shah exchanged 
their countries' "most wanted" lists of fugitives each 
capital seeks extradited.  Few observers believe any of the 
individuals on either list will be extradited or deported to 
the other country.  The GOP list reportedly contained the 
names of 58 individuals allegedly residing in India and 
wanted by Pakistani law enforcement; various Indian media 
reported that New Delhi's list contained the names of either 
35 or 38 fugitives from Indian law enforcement allegedly 
residing in Pakistan.  In past years, the Indian list 
numbered 20 individuals, and the names have been widely 
available in Indian press; we have not seen the current 
Indian list in open source reporting.  (NOTE Rediff.com in 
August 2005 reported that, during that round of Home 
Sec retary talks in New Delhi, the Indian list contained 
"nearly 30 names" including Mumbai mobster Dawood Ibrahim; 
terrorist leaders Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, and Syed 
Salahuddin; and United Liberation front of Assam chief Paresh 
Barua.  This list is also not clearly available in Indian 
news media.  End Note.)  End Summary. 
 
New List Hard to Come By 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C) Embassy contact and noted Delhi-based terrorism 
analyst Ajai Sahni gave Poloff what he said was a copy of the 
Indian "List and Details of Most Wanted Fugitives From Law in 
India Who are Residing in Pakistan" (see Para 5).  Sahni 
would not say whence he got the list, but he hinted it was 
drafted by the MEA using inputs from the Home Ministry, 
probably to include the Intelligence Bureau.  We know Sahni 
has contacts in the Home Ministry through his organization's 
patron, former Punjab Police Chief KPS Gill.  Our repeated 
efforts to obtain a copy of the list from the Foreign 
Ministry and the Pakistani High Commission were unsuccessful 
-- MEA Director (Pakistan) Jeeva Sagar told us the list was 
classified and could not be shared.  (COMMENT: On Indo-Pak 
matters, even when the MEA has been unresponsive, we are 
usually able to obtain copies of documents from the Pakistani 
High Commission.  This is perhaps the first time in two years 
we have met with failure on this front.  End Comment.)  The 
"List of 20" presented below for comparison (see Para 6) was 
compiled by Embassy New Delhi using open source reporting. 
 
New List Includes New Names; One Surprise Deletion 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3.  (C) The substantial differences between the two lists are 
clear.  The most significant aspect is that 13 new names are 
attributed to "D-Company," the criminal enterprise headed by 
Dawood Ibrahim; this brings to 21 the total D-Company 
representation on the Indian list, or approximately 60%.  The 
other notable aspect is the addition of two individuals 
suspected of involvement in the December 1999 hijacking of 
IC-814 (Reftel), bringing that compliment to six. 
 
¶4.  (C) Discrepancies between the two lists are noted within 
 
NEW DELHI 00005239  002 OF 007 
 
 
the text of the new list and most can be attributed to 
administrative or typographical errors.  Of primary note is 
that the more recent list does not include the #2 name on the 
"List of 20," Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, co-founder of 
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, the largest and most lethal jihadi groups 
operating in India, also involved in the December 2001 attack 
on Parliament -- a glaring omission. 
 
Uncertain Provenance, Discrepancies Cast Doubt 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  (C) To the best of our knowledge, Sahni has been a 
forthright interlocutor; he is a longtime Embassy contact and 
we respect his insights and analysis.  Not knowing the actual 
source of the newer list would normally cast little doubt of 
its veracity because of our relationship with Sahni, but the 
oversight of Hafiz Saeed causes us some concern on the 
document's validity.  Sahni responded to Poloff's surprise at 
the omission by suggesting it was an administrative error: 
"These things are drafted by semi-literate office workers who 
are just combining the inputs they receive.  Senior officers 
and diplomats seldom even look at the finished product before 
they hand it over."  He did, however, offer to go back to his 
source for the document for clarification.

Bio Notes: Ajai Sahni 
--------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Dr. Ajai Sahni earned his M.Phil and PhD from Delhi 
University; his dissertation topic was "Democracy, Dissent, 
and the Right to Information."  After a stint in academia -- 
the details of which he has not shared -- he entered 
journalism, writing for Delhi weeklies "Delhi Recorder," 
"Current," and "Surya."  Sahni helped found the Institute for 
Conflict Management with KPS Gill in 1997; he is currently 
ICM's Executive Director.  Within ICM, Sahni also performs 
 
NEW DELHI 00005239  007 OF 007 
 
 
the following functions: 
 
-- Editor of the weekly e-mail terrorism 
information/assessment service "South Asia Intelligence 
Review" 
 
-- Executive Editor of "Faultlines," ICM's quarterly journal, 
since its inception in 1999 
 
-- Executive Director of the South Asia Terrorism Portal 
(www.satp.org), since its 2000 launch 
 
-- Project Director of ICM's Database and Documentation 
Center on Conflict and Development in India's Northeast 
(Guwahati), supported by the Indian Council for Social 
Science Research 
 
-- Principal Investigator (Internal Security and 
Administration) for the Project on Planning and Development 
for India's Northeast, supported by the Canadian 
International Development Agency 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Sahni has also collaborated on the Project on 
Management of Insurgencies and the World Governance Survey, 
both under the auspices of the UN University.  He jointly 
edited two books on terrorism with KPS Gill: "Terror and 
Containment: Perspectives on India's Security" and "The 
Global Threat of Terror: Ideological, Material, and Political 
Linkages."  Sahni is extremely well read, and can quote 
literature, history, and political science -- including the 
works of Mao -- with ease.  When asked to prioritize India's 
terrorism problems, he always cites the Naxalites -- with 
their strategic vision, their steady accumulation of 
territory, and their institutions that take the place of 
non-performing state functions -- as the most threatening to 
India's long-term stability.  Sahni prefers green tea.
