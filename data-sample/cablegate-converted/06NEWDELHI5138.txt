SUBJECT: STORM CLOUDS GATHERING OVER PARLIAMENT 
 
REF: A. NEW DELHI 420Q QA"z_1in on July 24, the Left parties and the BJP/NDA 
opposition have signaled their intention to come out swinging 
and inflict as much damage as possible on the UPA/Congress. 
While one press report speculated that the NDA could call for 
a vote of confidence with the object of bringing down the 
UPA, the rest of the media has remained silent.  The NDA does 
not have enough seats to pull off such a move.  It is likely, 
however, to mount serious verbal attacks, accusing the UPA of 
failing to provide security, combat terrorism, hold down 
price increases and stem corruption.  There is a good 
likelihood that the Left, Right and regional parties will 
join in combined attacks against a beleaguered Congress/UPA. 
While the UPA is almost certainly assured of survival, it may 
have to expend more time and energy defending itself in a 
post session environment, leaving little impetus for 
aggressive policy goals.  End Summary. 
 
The Left Gearing-up for Action 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Communist leaders indicated on July 19 that they were 
determined to make life difficult for the UPA government and 
it "neo-liberal" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when 
Parliament convenes on July 24.  Zeroing in on economic 
policy, the Left Front (LF) accused the UPA of "failure" to 
check inflation and warned that the Congress Party "cannot 
take Left support for granted."  CPI(M) superstar and MP 
Brinda Karat accused the UPA of mimicking the previous NDA 
government's economic policies by reducing the number of 
items in the essential commodities list from 70 to 15.  CPI 
National Secretary D Raja attacked the UPA's food policy, 
stating "As far as food security is concerned, the UPA 
government has been a total failure.  Raja asserted that "We 
will raise the issue of agrarian crisis, including suicides 
by farmers, food crisis, price rise and general economic 
conditions in the coming monsoon session of Parliament." 
 
While the BJP is out for Blood 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (U) The "Asian Age" claimed on July 19 that the BJP 
leadership is seriously considering moving a no-confidence 
motion against the UPA government.  The account asserted that 
the NDA would call for the UPA government's dismissal for 
failing to control rising prices, curb terrorism or provide 
proper security to the nation.  The "Asian Age" was the only 
media outlet to speculate on this possibility. 
 
¶4.  (U) The BJP leadership met on July 20 to map out its 
Parliamentary strategy, and July 21 press reports made no 
mention of a possible no confidence motion.  They did 
confirm, however, that the BJP parliamentary delegation plans 
to march to the Presidential palace (Rashtrapati Bhavan) on 
July 24 and present President Abdul Kalam with a memorandum 
on "national security," it then plans to "adjourn" the tabled 
agenda and demand that Parliament devote the entire day to 
the impact of the Mumbai terrorist attack.  The BJP announced 
that during the monsoon session it plans to attack the UPA on 
four broad issues, national security (terrorism and the 
war-room spy case), inflation and price increases on 
petroleum and essential commodities, corruption (including 
 
NEW DELHI 00005138  002 OF 003 
 
 
the Volcker case against former Foreign Minister Natwar 
Singh) and agricultural policies (with a focus on farmers' 
suicides). 
 
But Willing to Compromise on Offices of Profit 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  (U)  Press reports indicate that the BJP opposes the 
"Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Bill, 
also known as the "office-of-profit Bill" put forward by 
Congress, as unconstitutional (Ref A).  However, the BJP has 
indicated that it will support an amended bill if it contains 
the following provisions:  that it conform to the 
Constitution in letter and spirit, allow current serving MP's 
and MLA's holding "offices of profit" to remain but "draw a 
firm line" on future violations, include a compromise 
provision that would discontinue all salaries, allowances and 
perquisites to MPs and MLAs currently holding "offices of 
profit." 
 
Some Regional Parties Willing to Back the BJP 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Press reports indicate that some influential regional 
parties will also join the opposition/left attacks on the 
UPA.  The Samajwadi Party (SP), the ruling party in Uttar 
Pradesh (UP), continues to support the UPA from outside, but 
has grown increasingly hostile to Congress in the run-up to 
the February 2007 UP elections and is likely to support 
opposition/Left attacks.  On July 19, Bahujan Samaj Party 
(BSP) President and former UP Chief Minister Mayawati also 
threatened to withdraw her party's support from the UPA if it 
failed to contain inflation.  On July 19, the Telegana 
Rashtra Samithi (TRS), an Andhra Pradesh (AP) regional party, 
which currently belongs to the UPA, issued an ultimatum 
threatening to withdraw from the UPA if the ruling coalition 
fails to support statehood for the Telengana region of AP 
before Independence Day on August 15. 
 
Growing Consensus Regarding UPA Vulnerability 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Journalists Sanjay Kapoor and Zafar Agha and Congress 
MP Rashid Alvi agreed on July 20 that the NDA would love to 
bring a vote of no-confidence to the floor of Parliament 
during the Monsoon session, as anti-UPA sentiment has 
increased dramatically in recent months.  They asserted that 
the purported "failure" of the GOI to prevent the Mumbai 
terrorist attack, the controversy surrounding the US/India 
Civil Nuclear Agreement (septel), the petroleum price hike 
and rising inflation, as well as serious allegations of UPA 
corruption provide plenty of ready-made issues for the 
opposition. 
 
But the Numbers Just Don't Add Up 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (C) While there is a growing consensus that the UPA is 
weak and vulnerable, almost no one is willing to predict that 
it will fall.  The numbers do not add up.  In a house of 529 
MPs, the NDA has only 171 seats.  It would have to garner 265 
seats to win a vote of confidence.  Likely candidates come 
from the SP (41 seats) and a combination of smaller regional 
parties (30 - 35 seats).  Even with the support of these 
parties, the NDA would fall short, and is unlikely to 
convince other UPA affiliates to cross over and join the 
opposition.  In addition, the BJP has no charismatic Prime 
Ministerial Candidate around which to build a no confidence 
 
NEW DELHI 00005138  003 OF 003 
 
 
motion, and there is little interest in Parliament for a 
change of government and a new election. 
 
Comment: A Stormy Session - But Life Goes On 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (C) It is almost a certainty in recent Indian politics 
that Parliamentary sessions are dominated by drama and little 
substance.  This session is unlikely to be different.  Should 
it turn into a free for all, with a wide swath of Left, Right 
and regional parties attacking the UPA, as many anticipate, 
the scene could be quite ugly.  Placed on the defensive, the 
Congress Party and Prime Minister Singh could present an 
image of a party in trouble, weak and on the defensive, 
furthering weakening the UPA.  In the post session 
environment, the UPA could then become more and more focused 
on survival and less on realizing ambitious goals.
