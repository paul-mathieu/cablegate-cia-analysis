 ¶1.  (C) Summary: Poloff delivered reftel on July 24.  MEA 
Undersecretary Jayant Khobargade (Disarmament and 
International Security) expressed GOI support for the 
initiative.  Iranian Foreign Minister Manochehr Mottaki 
confirmed in an Indian television interview that several 
high-profile and critical energy deals between Iran and India 
seem to have hit the skids, blaming this outcome on Indian 
objections to Iranian price increases.  There could be more 
to it than this, however, as Teheran may be using the energy 
deals to get back at New Delhi for its stance in the IAEA. 
End Summary. 
 
Indians Critical of Iranian Nuclear Objectives 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (C)  Poloff delivered reftel to MEA Undersecretary Jayant 
Khobargade (Disarmament and International Security) on July 
¶24.  Khobargade stated that the GOI fully supports this 
initiative and the P5 1 offer to Iran, and promised to 
forward it to his superiors. 
 
¶3.  (U) On July 23, the Indian television news channel NDTV 
broadcast an interview with Iranian Foreign Minister 
Manochehr Mottaki, in which he replied to Indian Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh's publicly voiced concerns about 
Iran's nuclear ambitions.  In the interview, Mottaki stated 
"we are transparent, Iran does not want and does not need 
nuclear weapons." 
 
Indian-Iranian Energy Deals Ready to go up in Smoke 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4.  (U) Mottaki also expressed doubt in the same interview 
that two critical energy deals between Iran and India will be 
completed, citing "changing circumstances from the time the 
deal was signed."  Iran reportedly  signed an agreement in 
2005 to supply India with 5 million tons of Liquefied Natural 
Gas for USD 22 billion.  According to Indian media. Iran is 
now seeking to raise the original price, from USD 3.25 to USD 
5.1 per million BTUs. 
 
¶5.  (U) The Associated Press reported on July 23 that Iran is 
also trying to renegotiate prices on the gas-pipeline deal it 
had made with India.  Iran reportedly wants the gas price 
linked to international oil prices, starting at USD 7.2 per 
million BTUs - but India has said it wants to pay no more 
than USD 4.25.  The GOI is reportedly looking at legal 
methods of enforcing the contract over Iran's objections. 
 
India's IAEA Stance Effecting Energy Deals 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (C) Though Mottaki denied any linkage between Iran's 
last-minute holdup on the energy deals and India's critical 
stance on Iran's nuclear ambitions, the timing seems 
suspicious.  India has twice voted against Iran in the IAEA, 
and the Indian Prime Minister spoke out recently in 
Parliament that "it is not in India's interest to have a 
nuclear-armed Iran."  Soon afterwards, Foreign Minister 
Mottaki canceled his scheduled ministerial visit to India, 
and four days later publicly announced that Iran is 
rethinking its prior commitments to India on the LNG energy 
deal that India desperately needs. (NOTE: The gas pipeline 
 
NEW DELHI 00005237  002 OF 002 
 
 
deal has been troubled for some time, and was expected to 
fail.)  Iran could be hitting back at India for its IAEA 
stance, using oil as a stick.
