SUBJECT: POLLING DATA SHOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR SONIA GANDHI 
 
Classified By: Charge Geoff Pyatt for reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  A poll commissioned by a leading Indian 
news network concluded that Sonia Gandhi remains India's most 
popular politician, with Manmohan Singh a distant third 
(after former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee). 
According to the results, Sonia Gandhi would enjoy solid 
majority support if she decided to project herself as India's 
next Prime Minister.  The poll results reinforce popular 
political wisdom, that the BJP/NDA does not, for now, pose a 
serious political threat to the UPA government.  It also 
documents growing dissatisfaction with the UPA's performance 
on the economy, internal security and agricultural issues. 
The preference for Sonia Gandhi adds fuel to a whispering 
campaign that suggests the UPA would be better served with 
someone other than Manmohan Singh at the helm.  Because India 
is a predominantly rural society characterized by pervasive 
poverty, inflation (particularly the prices of food staples) 
and agricultural issues predominate.  Any popular perception 
that the government is not responsive on these issues can 
quickly lead to its demise.  Likewise, foreign policy issues, 
such as relations with the US, carry little weight and 
generally do not decide elections.  End Summary. 
 
The CNN-IBN Poll 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) A prominent Indian think tank, the Centre for the 
Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) conducted a survey for 
the CNN-IBN television network between July 16-19.  It 
administered a questionnaire to 1,884 respondents regarding 
their attitudes towards Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and 
Sonia Gandhi and other leadership-related issues. 
 
Sonia Most Popular Politician in India 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  According to the survey, Sonia Gandhi is far and 
away the most popular political figure in the country, 
eclipsing Prime Minister Singh by a wide margin.  When asked 
who they would prefer for Prime Minister if an election were 
held today, the breakdown was as follows: 
 
Sonia Gandhi -    29 percent 
 
Atal Behari Vajpayee -  21 percent 
 
Manmohan Singh -  16 percent 
 
LK Advani -       2 percent 
 
Sonia Calls the Shots 
--------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Fifty two percent of those surveyed supported the 
immediate replacement of Singh as PM with Sonia Gandhi. 
Despite the differences in popular support between Singh and 
Gandhi, 56 percent of the respondents said they remained 
"satisfied" with his performance.  The respondents expressed 
admiration for Manmohan Singh's "honesty" and "wisdom," but 
were generally not convinced that he was a strong leader. 
Only 8 percent stated that he takes important decisions on 
his own (that is without seeking prior approval from Sonia 
Gandhi).  Fully 22 percent of the respondents believed that 
Sonia Gandhi is making all important decisions in the UPA 
government.  Forty seven percent said they had no idea who 
was making decisions.

Poor Ratings on Security, the Economy and Agriculture 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Respondents gave the UPA government poor marks on 
internal security (terrorism), the economy ("price rises") 
and agriculture ("farmers' suicides"), with 56 percent 
expressing dissatisfaction over the GOI's handling of 
inflation, and only 22 percent saying they were "satisfied" 
with the UPA's performance on terrorism and "farmers 
suicides." 
 
The BJP Not a Threat 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) The survey results indicate that while the UPA does 
not win high marks for its performance, the BJP is held in 
even less regard.  However, it is apparent that the BJP took 
note of the survey results (and likely its own polling data), 
when crafting its political strategy.  The BJP/NDA has used 
the opening two days of the monsoon parliament session to 
hammer Congress on its purported "failure" to provide 
internal security and prevent terrorist attacks, and 
"inability" to keep down inflation or provide economic 
security to embattled farmers.  However, the BJP is 
disorganized and deeply-divided, and enjoys low public 
confidence and may not be in a good position to benefit from 
its aggressive attacks.  Congress remains confident that the 
BJP/NDA does not, for now, present a serious threat. 
 
Economic Issues and Personal Security 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) India is a heavily rural society dominated by 
pervasive poverty.  It therefore comes as no surprise that 
the average Indian remains preoccupied with 
rural/agricultural issues and the prices of essential 
commodities.  Most Indians survive from one day to the next 
with no margin to deal with even minute price increases in 
essential staples such as onions, pulses, potatoes, flour and 
rice.  One out of every two malnourished people in the world 
currently live in India, with malnutrition the norm among 
India's poor.  Any price increases in essential staples 
quickly eat into the family diet and cause consternation and 
suffering.  Should the perception become widespread that UPA 
economic policies are encouraging price increases in these 
staples, it could quickly undermine popular support for this 
government and provide a ready-made issue for the opposition. 
 Likewise, most Indians are fed up with constant terrorist 
attacks and the Indian police are almost universally loathed. 
 The polling data suggests that most Indians are skeptical 
that the UPA has the terrorist situation under control and is 
capable of providing day to day security.  The survey did not 
include questions regarding the performance of the 
Left/Communist parties or provide a popularity rating for the 
CPI(M)'s Prakash Karat as a potential Prime Minister.  The 
mix of issues upon which the Indian public is now focused is 
custom-made for the Left, which is in a better position to 
capitalize on them over the long term than the BJP and is 
causing Congress to constantly look over its left shoulder.
