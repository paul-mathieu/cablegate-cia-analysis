MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence 


SUBJECT : (a) Executive Committee Meeting -- 

Monday Afternoon 

(b) Staff Meeting -- Tuesday Morning 


25X1 


1. The question has been raised as to why we have an 
Executive Committee Meeting on Monday afternoon followed by a 
Staff Meeting consisting of approximately the same personnel the 
first thing the next morning. The purpose of this memorandum is 
to delineate the functions of these two bodies and to seek your ap- 
proval of the principles governing the agendas, 

Z. The Exe c uti ve Committe e is primarily designed to be 
a policy and planning group which will meet regularly to review the 
important activities of the Agency and to recommend to the Director 
action. It is a deliberative body in that the primary purpose of the 
presentations to it is to evoke discussion in an effort to arrive at a 
decision. It will deal with all types of matters, e.g., whether capital 

[ should be increased, or at the other extreme, 
whether the Agency should pay overtime to personnel above certain 
grades. While the Financial Policy and Budget Committee will 
consider in the first instance plans and programs and new projects, 
the Executive Committee will be the body that will place the stamp 
of approval on the recommendations of the Financial Policy and 
Budget Committee. In effect, these two committees will replace 
the old Project Review Committee. By a similar token, the Execu- 
tive Committee should devote at least one session bi-monthly, or 
perhaps even more often, to considerations of personnel policy, 
personnel management, and even promotions in the super grade 
area. In this fashion the Executive Committee will replace the 
Career Council and the Super Grade Board. 

3. The weekly _Staff Meetin g is more of an informative 
session at which matters of a broad general interest to the Agency 
are presented for the information of those present rather than 
necessarily for action. On the other hand, it is quite possible that

action will be taken at the Staff Meeting, where such a step is indi- 
cated; e. g. , the focal point for Agency action on Presidential trips 
abroad. Both the Executive Committee Meeting and the Staff Meet- 
ing serve to replace the three times a week meeting of the Deputies 
held by the previous Director. 

4. As to persons attending the two meetings, the ten statutory 
members (including the Chairman) of the Executive Committee Meeting 
also attend the Staff Meeting. In addition to these ten, the A/DDP, 

AD/ Cl, Assistant for Coordination, Assistant to the DCI (Col, Grogan) 
also attend the Staff Meeting and are often supplemented by others who 
are making special presentations. Previously we used to hold a 
monthly meeting of the heads of all components -- approximately 35. 

It might be feasible to expand the weekly Staff Meeting to include all 
of these, now that we are in a singlâ‚¬; building, or to reduce the number 
of Staff Meetings to bi-weekly or monthly. 

5. I feel quite strongly that periodic meetings at which the 
command echelon in the Agency can make its presence and views felt 
by the working level are most important. I believe that if these meet- 
ings are held as infrequently as monthly, the impact is not sufficiently 
great, especially when inevitably the DCI and/or DDCI will miss some 
of the monthly meetings. I therefore recommend that we expand the 
present Staff Meetings to include the heads of all major components 
and hold them bi-weekly.
