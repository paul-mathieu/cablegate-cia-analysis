1. In response t o your memorandum, and per the buck 

slip from I have investigated the handling of the 

letter from Congressman Auchincloss. Attached are the memo- 
randa from Legislative Counsel and the Director of Personnel 
which indicate that the letter was slow in reaching the Personnel 
Office, and that there was delay in that office in acting upon it. 
Both the offices of Legislative Counsel and Personnel indicate 
that they are tightening up their procedures in this regard. 

2. You should also know that two weeks ago, but not 
soon enough to affect the letter from Congressman Auchincloss, 

I instituted certain procedures in handling all congressional mail. 
In order to expedite the receipt of the mail, all congressional 
mail is immediately d elivered to my office rather than going 
through | 


who then routed it ta 


who 

routed it to whomever would prepare the reply. Under the new 
system the mail is delivered to my desk immediately; I call the 
appropriate office to start their action on the letter, and then 
ask | office to pick up the letter by hand and move 

it on promptly. I believe that this new system will actually speed 
up congressional mail by a matter of weeks rather than days. 

We have also instituted the practice of telephoning the office of 
the congressman within 24 hours to advise of the receipt of the 
letter and that action is taking place on it. Finally, we are

congressional mail, in addition to that in the Legislative 
Counsel's office and in the Office of Personnel.

MEMORANDUM FOR: 
VIA 


Legislative Counsel 
Director of Personnel 

Inspector General 


I am extremely embarrassed at the delay in your two 
offices in the handling of a letter dated February 17 from 
Congressman James C. Auchincloss. The draft reply to this 
letter reached my office on March 8, and was immediately 
dispatched, and then only after we had received a second letter 
from the Congressman, asking "to let me hear from you without 
further delay. " 

I wish an immediate investigation in your two offices, 
in concert, to determine the responsibility for the delay in 
handling this simple piece of correspondence. Also, I wish 
the Office of Legislative Counsel, as it refers mail.to keep a 
careful check on the referral and to see that the office to which 
such mail is referred responds promptly. 

I am now establishing a check, either in this office or 
in the Office of the Inspector General, of any Congressional 
mail that is referred, and strong measures will be taken if 
Congressional mail is not handled promptly and efficiently.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 

SUBJECT: Handling of Mail from Members of Congress 


1. I sincerely regret the delay in the handling of the letter 
dated 17 February 1961 from Congressman James C. Auchincloss and 
I wish to apologize for the embarrassment caused you. We are, of 
course, aware of the necessity for prompt replies to congressional 
inquiries on the basis of both good business and as a simple matter 
of courtesy. This particular incident is not representative of the 
normal flow of congressional mail. 

2. While the letter from Mr. Auchincloss is dated 17 February, 
apparently it was not received in the Agency until 20 February. It was 
then received in my office on 23 February and dispatched the same day 
to the Personnel Office. It was returned to this office on 6 March. 

Upon review of the letter, it was determined to be not completely 
responsive and was rewritten in this office and delivered to the Office 
of the Director on 8 March. 

3. This office maintains a suspense check on all congressional 
mail referred to other offices whether for preparation of a reply or for 
provision of information except for letters dealing with personnel 
matters. By arrangement with the Director of Personnel when 1 first 
assumed the responsibilities for this office, it was agreed that Personnel 
would maintain a suspense procedure and that we would not duplicate it 
here. This has now been changed and we will maintain suspense lists 
for all congressional mail without exception. Another improvement 

was instituted approximately ten days ago wherein congressional mail 
opened in Executive Registry is delivered directly to the Inspector 
General for noting and direct forwarding to this office for action.

4. Mr. Echols and I have instituted additional procedures and 
controls designed to assure proper and timely handling of this type of 
correspondence. In addition, I have reviewed and revised procedures 
within this office designed to insure timely replies to all congressional b I A I 


mail.
